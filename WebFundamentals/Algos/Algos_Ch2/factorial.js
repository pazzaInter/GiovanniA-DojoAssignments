//Just the Facts, ma'am. Factorials, that is. Write a function factorial(num) that, given a number, returns the product (multiplication) of all positive integers from 1 up to number (inclusive).

//Example: factorial(3) = 6 (or 1 * 2 * 3); factorial(5) = 120 (or 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5).

function factorial(num) {
    var product = 1;
    for (var i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
        product *= i;
    }
    return product;
}

console.log(factorial(5));
